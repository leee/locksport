Drivers: To calculate drivers,
add 7 to the control key cut and subtract from 16.
This calculation is constant throughout the system.

MANY A3 SYSTEMS DO NOT USE CHANGE KEYS

EMHART HIGH SECURITY KEYING RESTRICTIONS
----------------------------------------


1.  NO # 1 CUTS ALLOWED -- CUT WILL BE TOO
    SHALLOW TO MAINTAIN ANGLE
  * EVEN THOUGH THESE CYLINDERS ARE COMPATIBLE
    WITH SYSTEM 70, PROGRESSION IS LIMITED TO 2 - 6

  * MIXING THESE HIGH SECURITY CYLINDERS WITH
    CONVENTIONAL SYSTEM 70 CYLINDERS MUST BE
    CAREFULLY PLANNED FROM INCEPTION -- PLEASE REFER
    TO THE CORBIN/RUSSWIN CYLINDER MANUAL
    FOR MORE INFORMATION

2.  THERE IS NO # 1 MASTER PIN --
    THEREFORE CHANGE KEY CUT MUST BE
    AT LEAST 2 STEPS FROM MASTER CUT

3.  MACS IS DEPENDENT ON ADJACENT ANGLES
    WHEN ADJACENT ANGLES ARE THE SAME, MACS IS 4
    WHEN ADJACENT ANGLES ARE DIFFERENT, MACS IS 3

4.  CHANGE KEY CUTS CANNOT BE THE SAME DEPTH AS
    CONTROL KEY CUTS IN BOTH CONTROL CHAMBERS,
    REGARDLESS OF THE ANGLES

5.  WHEN THE BOTTOM AND MASTER PINS TOTAL 2, 3, OR 4,
    THE DRIVER IS A # 1

    WHEN THE BOTTOM AND MASTER PINS TOTAL 5 OR 6,
    THE DRIVER IS A # 2.

    THIS DOES NOT APPLY TO THE CONTROL CHAMBERS.
    SEE # 6 BELOW.

6.  CONTROL CHAMBERS USE CONVENTIONAL PINS, THEREFORE THEY
    USE DIFFERENT DRIVERS AND BUILD-UP PINS

Drivers: Chambers 1, 2, 5 and 6 have a stack height of 15.

Control chambers 3 and 4: stack height is 20.
Add 8 to the control key cut and subtract from 20.
This is constant throughout the system.

SARGENT INTERCHANGEABLE CORE KEYING RESTRICTIONS
------------------------------------------------

1.  CONTROL CUT CANNOT BE THE SAME AS THE
    CORRESPONDING MASTER CUT

2.  CONTROL CUT AND CORRESPONDING MASTER CUT
    MUST BE WITHIN 7 STEPS OF EACH OTHER.

3.  IF THE MASTER CUT IS EVEN, CORRESPONDING
    CONTROL CUT MUST BE EVEN

4.  IF THE MASTER CUT IS ODD, CORRESPONDING
    CONTROL CUT MUST BE ODD

5.  CHANGE KEY CUTS CANNOT BE THE SAME AS
    CONTROL KEY CUTS IN BOTH CONTROL CHAMBERS

Non-control chambers use a #0 driver.
In the control chambers  the drivers are the same
number as the corresponding control key cut. 
This is constant throughout the system.

SYSTEM 70 KEYING RESTRICTIONS
-----------------------------

1.  No #1 cut allowed in the control position of the
    control key.

2.  The control key must be the same as the master key
    except for 2 positions (the two different positions
    must be in position 2, 3, 4 or 5)

3.  The two control cuts that are different may not be
    used in the system progression.

4.  If the system is also using high security cylinders,
    the two different positions must be positions 2 and 3.
    These are the only two control chambers in the
    high security cylinders.
