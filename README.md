## tools
* I've always been a big fan of [Peterson](http://www.thinkpeterson.com/). Ken
Persson never fails to achieve!
* My goto cutter is the [Blitz](http://www.hpcworld.com/mobile/km/blitz/). An
absolute workhorse.
* Sparrows has a really nice pinning tweezer, the [King Pin]
(http://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/t1.htm). It's probably the only
tool I have from them, but it's a very good buy.
* Otherwise, I prefer to 3D print pinning trays, mockups, plugs, etc. I believe
models can be had online. I have been told however that LAB and Sparrows have
nice pinning mats.

## locks
* If you're deploying a system, [Security Snobs](https://securitysnobs.com/)
offers locks in pretty much any variety for the Protec2 Elite and can do
grand master/subregion keying. Even better, they offer large lot locks, so you
can order your next fun lock while continuing to build out your setup.
* Otherwise, if you're going for convenience, you can probably build out a
Best/Arrow SFIC setup, if not a Schlage Everest Primus setup.
* I would've also recommended a Mul-T-Lock buildout, but after discovering
they're absurdly easy to pick, I no longer use them.

## storage
Pelican typically does a great job with their cases. A few notes:
* Don't get the Elite Luggage series (BA/EL). No one in their right mind would.
* Storm cases just have a fancy latch - not worth it.
* The 1510 is the standard size for carry-ons, and is what I use daily. No need
for the 1510M, that's just absurd.
* You could build a very nice radio/QRP rig around the 1400.
* Pelican's armory cases fit bows very well.
* The BlackBox/Composite/MAC/SuperMAC/Classic/Pro rackmount series of cases are
pretty good. I've hauled network, servers, UPSes, and other infrastructure with
no problems. You can get sound setups to be rackmount too.
* Best of all, these cases will fit an Abloy PL 321, if not the 330 or even 342.
